# wordcloud_firefox_search_keyword

This generates the wordcloud of firefox's search keyword. if the occurrence of word is more than other, that word has more visibility and larger size compare to other words.

It's fun to see which words are frequently search. Suggestions are welcome.

I'm using the wordcloud library developed by https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud
